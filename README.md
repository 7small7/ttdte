# Introduction

Composer Extension for Simplifying Development.

To simplify repetitive code in daily development, we have developed a Composer extension package that provides utility
functions for date handling, encryption, and data validation. Below is a detailed introduction and usage guide for this
package.

## Function Overview

- Date Handling: Provides functions for date formatting, date calculations (such as adding or subtracting days, months,
  etc.), and date range processing.

- Encryption: Supports data encryption and decryption, including symmetric encryption (e.g., AES-128, AES-256), and file
  encryption.

- Data Validation: Offers various data validation rules, such as string validation, email format validation, and
  password strength validation.

# Installation

Install the package via Composer:

```shell
composer require ttdte/verify
```
